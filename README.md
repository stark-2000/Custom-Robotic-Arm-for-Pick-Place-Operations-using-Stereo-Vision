## Overview:
Engineered a cutting-edge 𝟔-𝗗𝗼𝗙 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗽𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 from the ground up, employing innovative 3D printed designs and assembly, subsequently programmed for essential 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗸 & 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 functionalities utilizing 𝗠𝗢𝗩𝗘𝗶𝘁 and 𝗥𝗢𝗦 𝟮 frameworks.


## Key Achievements:
✦ 𝗘𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆:
- Utilized 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘀 and a custom-built 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗼 𝗱𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗵 𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝘆 to enhance perception accuracy, crucial for precise manipulation tasks.

✦ 𝗥𝗼𝗯𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴:
- Constructed a comprehensive 𝗨𝗥𝗗𝗙 model in 𝗦𝗢𝗟𝗜𝗗𝗪𝗢𝗥𝗞𝗦, rigorously tested in 𝗚𝗮𝘇𝗲𝗯𝗼 before integration with MOVEit for precise programming and validation.

✦ 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗠𝗼𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹:
- Implemented 𝗔𝗿𝗱𝘂𝗶𝗻𝗼 Pro mini as the motor controller and high-torque DC servos, facilitating inter-servo communication via 𝗗𝗮𝗶𝘀𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 or 𝗶𝟮𝗰 interface, ensuring smooth and 𝘀𝘆𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱 motion.

✦ 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
- Conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation against the industry-standard 𝗨𝗥𝟱𝗲 industrial manipulator for identical 𝗽𝗶𝗰𝗸 & 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲 tasks, showcasing the capabilities of our design.

✦ 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗘𝗹𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
- Developed and fabricated a 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺 𝗣𝗖𝗕 with Arduino and interface circuitry, precisely tailored to the manipulator's 𝗖𝗔𝗗 model, ensuring optimal functionality and seamless integration.


## Demo Videos:
- Demo1_without_Dume: In this video we are trying to extract the real world 3D coordinates of an object using YOLOv8 and Stereo Camera
    - https://youtu.be/uZFN3-d_hQE 
- Demo2_with_Dume: In the previous part, we extracted the real world 3D coordinate of the object of interest, so in this video we are publishing the extracted coordinates to ROS MoveIT which plans a trajectory using KDL IK solver and RRT planner and publishes the joint angles to hardware servo motors and Gazebo model.
